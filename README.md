# AlgorithmsCourse
In this Algorithm Course we will cover some major type of DS and it's different implementation also some sorting and searching techniques

### [Backtracking](./Backtracking)
The Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique to solve a problem by an incremental way. It uses recursive approach to solve the problems. We can say that the backtracking is used to find all possible combination to solve an optimization problem.

### [Bit-Algorithm](./Bit-Algorithm)
The Bitwise Algorithms are used to perform operations at bit-level or to manipulate bits in different ways. The bitwise operations are found to be much faster and are some times used to improve the efficiency of a program.

### [Dynamic Programming](./DynamicProg)
Dynamic programming (usually referred to as DP ) is a very powerful technique to solve a particular class of problems. It demands very elegant formulation of the approach and simple thinking and the coding part is very easy. The idea is very simple, If you have solved a problem with the given input, then save the result for future reference, so as to avoid solving the same problem again.. shortly 'Remember your Past' :) .

### [Trees](./Trees)
A tree is recursively defined as a set of one or more nodes where one node is designated as the root of the tree and all the remaining nodes can be partitioned into non-empty sets each of which is a sub-tree of the root.
